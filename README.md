# Assignment: 05 Challenge Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The application is a daily planner. The application will take in inputs at each time and save to local storage when the save button on the right of each corresponding hour is pressed. The planner tracks the current date and is automatically populated at the top of the page. The hours of the day are also tracked. Depending on the time that the user uses the application, set styling will highlight whether the hour has passed, is the current hour, or the hour is in the future.
